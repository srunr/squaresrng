The BigCrush test was run on a Windows 10 computer. 

Cygwin64 and TestU01 will need to be installed.

Information regarding this may be found at

     http://www.cygwin.com

Note: I used the following commands when building TestU01:

     unzip TestU01.zip

     cd TestU01-1.2.3

     ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=/usr

     make

     make install 

===========================================================================

The BigCrush test program may be built by typing make:

     make

The test may be run by typing make run:

     make run

The file bigcrushtest.out in this directory is the output file I obtained when

running the test.
